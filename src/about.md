# Rust API Guidelines

This is a set of recommendations on how to design and present APIs for
the Rust programming language. They are authored largely by the Rust
library team, based on experiences building the Rust standard library
and other crates in the Rust ecosystem.

These are only guidelines, some more firm than others. In some cases
they are vague and still in development. Rust crate authors should
consider them as a set of important considerations in the development
of idiomatic and interoperable Rust libraries, to use as they see
fit. These guidelines should not in any way be considered a mandate
that crate authors must follow, though they may find that crates that
conform well to these guidelines integrate better with the existing
crate ecosystem than those that do not.

This books is organized in two parts: the concise [checklist] of all
individual guidelines, suitable for quick scanning during crate
reviews; and topical chapters containing explanations of the
guidelines in detail.
